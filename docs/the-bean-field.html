          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="176">As&nbsp;I&nbsp;had little aid from horses or&nbsp;cattle, or&nbsp;hired men or&nbsp;boys, or&nbsp;improved implements of&nbsp;husbandry, I&nbsp;was much slower, and became much more intimate with my&nbsp;beans than usual.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="36" id="idea36" data-nb-words="34" data-nb-chars="169">But here were two acres and a&nbsp;half of&nbsp;furrows, and only a&nbsp;hoe for cart and two hands to&nbsp;draw it—there being an&nbsp;aversion to&nbsp;other carts and horses—and chip dirt far away.</span>
