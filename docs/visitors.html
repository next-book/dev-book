          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="54" data-nb-chars="307">But if&nbsp;twenty came and sat in&nbsp;my&nbsp;house there was nothing said about dinner, though there might be&nbsp;bread enough for two, more than if&nbsp;eating were a&nbsp;forsaken habit; but we&nbsp;naturally practised abstinence; and this was never felt to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;offence against hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course.</span>
