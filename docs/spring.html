          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="119">But such was not the effect on&nbsp;Walden that year, for she had soon got a&nbsp;thick new garment to&nbsp;take the place of&nbsp;the old.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="35" data-nb-chars="180">This pond never breaks up&nbsp;so&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the others in&nbsp;this neighborhood, on&nbsp;account both of&nbsp;its greater depth and its having no&nbsp;stream passing through it&nbsp;to&nbsp;melt or&nbsp;wear away the ice.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="5" id="idea5" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="119">I&nbsp;never knew it&nbsp;to&nbsp;open in&nbsp;the course of&nbsp;a&nbsp;winter, not excepting that of&nbsp;’52–3, which gave the ponds so&nbsp;severe a&nbsp;trial.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="6" id="idea6" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="191">It&nbsp;commonly opens about the first of&nbsp;April, a&nbsp;week or&nbsp;ten days later than Flint’s Pond and Fair Haven, beginning to&nbsp;melt on&nbsp;the north side and in&nbsp;the shallower parts where it&nbsp;began to&nbsp;freeze.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="7" id="idea7" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="140">It&nbsp;indicates better than any water hereabouts the absolute progress of&nbsp;the season, being least affected by&nbsp;transient changes of&nbsp;temperature.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="8" id="idea8" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="166">A&nbsp;severe cold of&nbsp;a&nbsp;few days’ duration in&nbsp;March may very much retard the opening of&nbsp;the former ponds, while the temperature of&nbsp;Walden increases almost uninterruptedly.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="9" id="idea9" data-nb-words="53" data-nb-chars="265">A&nbsp;thermometer thrust into the middle of&nbsp;Walden on&nbsp;the 6th of&nbsp;March, 1847, stood at&nbsp;32°, or&nbsp;freezing point; near the shore at&nbsp;33°; in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;Flint’s Pond, the same day, at&nbsp;32½°; at&nbsp;a&nbsp;dozen rods from the shore, in&nbsp;shallow water, under ice a&nbsp;foot thick, at&nbsp;36°.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="10" id="idea10" data-nb-words="45" data-nb-chars="246">This difference of&nbsp;three and a&nbsp;half degrees between the temperature of&nbsp;the deep water and the shallow in&nbsp;the latter pond, and the fact that a&nbsp;great proportion of&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;comparatively shallow, show why it&nbsp;should break up&nbsp;so&nbsp;much sooner than Walden.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="11" id="idea11" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="90">The ice in&nbsp;the shallowest part was at&nbsp;this time several inches thinner than in&nbsp;the middle.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="12" id="idea12" data-nb-words="13" data-nb-chars="72">In&nbsp;midwinter the middle had been the warmest and the ice thinnest there.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="13" id="idea13" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="265">So, also, everyone who has waded about the shores of&nbsp;the pond in&nbsp;summer must have perceived how much warmer the water is&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the shore, where only three or&nbsp;four inches deep, than a&nbsp;little distance out, and on&nbsp;the surface where it&nbsp;is&nbsp;deep, than near the bottom.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="14" id="idea14" data-nb-words="96" data-nb-chars="530">In&nbsp;spring the sun not only exerts an&nbsp;influence through the increased temperature of&nbsp;the air and earth, but its heat passes through ice a&nbsp;foot or&nbsp;more thick, and is&nbsp;reflected from the bottom in&nbsp;shallow water, and so&nbsp;also warms the water and melts the under side of&nbsp;the ice, at&nbsp;the same time that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;melting it&nbsp;more directly above, making it&nbsp;uneven, and causing the air bubbles which it&nbsp;contains to&nbsp;extend themselves upward and downward until it&nbsp;is&nbsp;completely honeycombed, and at&nbsp;last disappears suddenly in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single spring rain.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="15" id="idea15" data-nb-words="42" data-nb-chars="217">Ice has its grain as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;wood, and when a&nbsp;cake begins to&nbsp;rot or&nbsp;“comb,” that is, assume the appearance of&nbsp;honeycomb, whatever may be&nbsp;its position, the air cells are at&nbsp;right angles with what was the water surface.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="16" id="idea16" data-nb-words="74" data-nb-chars="407">Where there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rock or&nbsp;a&nbsp;log rising near to&nbsp;the surface the ice over it&nbsp;is&nbsp;much thinner, and is&nbsp;frequently quite dissolved by&nbsp;this reflected heat; and I&nbsp;have been told that in&nbsp;the experiment at&nbsp;Cambridge to&nbsp;freeze water in&nbsp;a&nbsp;shallow wooden pond, though the cold air circulated underneath, and so&nbsp;had access to&nbsp;both sides, the reflection of&nbsp;the sun from the bottom more than counterbalanced this advantage.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="17" id="idea17" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="265">When a&nbsp;warm rain in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the winter melts off the snow-ice from Walden, and leaves a&nbsp;hard dark or&nbsp;transparent ice on&nbsp;the middle, there will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;strip of&nbsp;rotten though thicker white ice, a&nbsp;rod or&nbsp;more wide, about the shores, created by&nbsp;this reflected heat.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="18" id="idea18" data-nb-words="19" data-nb-chars="111">Also, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;have said, the bubbles themselves within the ice operate as&nbsp;burning-glasses to&nbsp;melt the ice beneath.</span></p>
        <p class="chunk" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="chunk3" data-nb-words="380" data-nb-chars="2017"><span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="19" id="idea19" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="74">The phenomena of&nbsp;the year take place every day in&nbsp;a&nbsp;pond on&nbsp;a&nbsp;small scale.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="20" id="idea20" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="210">Every morning, generally speaking, the shallow water is&nbsp;being warmed more rapidly than the deep, though it&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;made so&nbsp;warm after all, and every evening it&nbsp;is&nbsp;being cooled more rapidly until the morning.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="21" id="idea21" data-nb-words="8" data-nb-chars="34">The day is&nbsp;an&nbsp;epitome of&nbsp;the year.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="23" id="idea23" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="69">The cracking and booming of&nbsp;the ice indicate a&nbsp;change of&nbsp;temperature.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="54" data-nb-chars="274">One pleasant morning after a&nbsp;cold night, February 24th, 1850, having gone to&nbsp;Flint’s Pond to&nbsp;spend the day, I&nbsp;noticed with surprise, that when I&nbsp;struck the ice with the head of&nbsp;my&nbsp;axe, it&nbsp;resounded like a&nbsp;gong for many rods around, or&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I&nbsp;had struck on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tight drumhead.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="48" data-nb-chars="257">The pond began to&nbsp;boom about an&nbsp;hour after sunrise, when it&nbsp;felt the influence of&nbsp;the sun’s rays slanted upon it&nbsp;from over the hills; it&nbsp;stretched itself and yawned like a&nbsp;waking man with a&nbsp;gradually increasing tumult, which was kept up&nbsp;three or&nbsp;four hours.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="26" id="idea26" data-nb-words="20" data-nb-chars="108">It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;short siesta at&nbsp;noon, and boomed once more toward night, as&nbsp;the sun was withdrawing his influence.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="85">In&nbsp;the right stage of&nbsp;the weather a&nbsp;pond fires its evening gun with great regularity.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="209">But in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the day, being full of&nbsp;cracks, and the air also being less elastic, it&nbsp;had completely lost its resonance, and probably fishes and muskrats could not then have been stunned by&nbsp;a&nbsp;blow on&nbsp;it.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="29" id="idea29" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="96">The fishermen say that the “thundering of&nbsp;the pond” scares the fishes and prevents their biting.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="30" id="idea30" data-nb-words="29" data-nb-chars="161">The pond does not thunder every evening, and I&nbsp;cannot tell surely when to&nbsp;expect its thundering; but though I&nbsp;may perceive no&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;the weather, it&nbsp;does.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="88">Who would have suspected so&nbsp;large and cold and thick-skinned a&nbsp;thing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;so&nbsp;sensitive?</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="22" data-nb-chars="108">Yet it&nbsp;has its law to&nbsp;which it&nbsp;thunders obedience when it&nbsp;should as&nbsp;surely as&nbsp;the buds expand in&nbsp;the spring.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="38" id="idea38" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="230">I&nbsp;am&nbsp;on&nbsp;the alert for the first signs of&nbsp;spring, to&nbsp;hear the chance note of&nbsp;some arriving bird, or&nbsp;the striped squirrel’s chirp, for his stores must be&nbsp;now nearly exhausted, or&nbsp;see the woodchuck venture out of&nbsp;his winter quarters.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="39" id="idea39" data-nb-words="23" data-nb-chars="119">On&nbsp;the 13th of&nbsp;March, after I&nbsp;had heard the bluebird, song sparrow, and redwing, the ice was still nearly a&nbsp;foot thick.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="40" id="idea40" data-nb-words="87" data-nb-chars="467">As&nbsp;the weather grew warmer it&nbsp;was not sensibly worn away by&nbsp;the water, nor broken up&nbsp;and floated off as&nbsp;in&nbsp;rivers, but, though it&nbsp;was completely melted for half a&nbsp;rod in&nbsp;width about the shore, the middle was merely honeycombed and saturated with water, so&nbsp;that you could put your foot through it&nbsp;when six inches thick; but by&nbsp;the next day evening, perhaps, after a&nbsp;warm rain followed by&nbsp;fog, it&nbsp;would have wholly disappeared, all gone off with the fog, spirited away.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="41" id="idea41" data-nb-words="14" data-nb-chars="80">One year I&nbsp;went across the middle only five days before it&nbsp;disappeared entirely.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="206" id="idea206" data-nb-words="16" data-nb-chars="96">This sight reminded me&nbsp;of&nbsp;falconry and what nobleness and poetry are associated with that sport.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="208" id="idea208" data-nb-words="10" data-nb-chars="53">It&nbsp;was the most ethereal flight I&nbsp;had ever witnessed.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="209" id="idea209" data-nb-words="65" data-nb-chars="352">It&nbsp;did not simply flutter like a&nbsp;butterfly, nor soar like the larger hawks, but it&nbsp;sported with proud reliance in&nbsp;the fields of&nbsp;air; mounting again and again with its strange chuckle, it&nbsp;repeated its free and beautiful fall, turning over and over like a&nbsp;kite, and then recovering from its lofty tumbling, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;it&nbsp;had never set its foot on&nbsp;terra firma.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="210" id="idea210" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="138">It&nbsp;appeared to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;companion in&nbsp;the universe—sporting there alone—and to&nbsp;need none but the morning and the ether with which it&nbsp;played.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="211" id="idea211" data-nb-words="12" data-nb-chars="60">It&nbsp;was not lonely, but made all the earth lonely beneath it.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="213" id="idea213" data-nb-words="55" data-nb-chars="279">The tenant of&nbsp;the air, it&nbsp;seemed related to&nbsp;the earth but by&nbsp;an&nbsp;egg hatched some time in&nbsp;the crevice of&nbsp;a&nbsp;crag;—or was its native nest made in&nbsp;the angle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloud, woven of&nbsp;the rainbow’s trimmings and the sunset sky, and lined with some soft midsummer haze caught up&nbsp;from earth?</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="214" id="idea214" data-nb-words="6" data-nb-chars="31">Its eyry now some cliffy cloud.</span></p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="218" id="idea218" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="45">There needs no&nbsp;stronger proof of&nbsp;immortality.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="223" id="idea223" data-nb-words="51" data-nb-chars="285">We&nbsp;need the tonic of&nbsp;wildness—to wade sometimes in&nbsp;marshes where the bittern and the meadow-hen lurk, and hear the booming of&nbsp;the snipe; to&nbsp;smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to&nbsp;the ground.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="224" id="idea224" data-nb-words="37" data-nb-chars="220">At&nbsp;the same time that we&nbsp;are earnest to&nbsp;explore and learn all things, we&nbsp;require that all things be&nbsp;mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be&nbsp;infinitely wild, unsurveyed and unfathomed by&nbsp;us&nbsp;because unfathomable.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="225" id="idea225" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="35">We&nbsp;can never have enough of&nbsp;nature.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="226" id="idea226" data-nb-words="40" data-nb-chars="247">We&nbsp;must be&nbsp;refreshed by&nbsp;the sight of&nbsp;inexhaustible vigor, vast and titanic features, the seacoast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and its decaying trees, the thundercloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks and produces freshets.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="227" id="idea227" data-nb-words="17" data-nb-chars="101">We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we&nbsp;never wander.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="228" id="idea228" data-nb-words="25" data-nb-chars="150">We&nbsp;are cheered when we&nbsp;observe the vulture feeding on&nbsp;the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us, and deriving health and strength from the repast.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="229" id="idea229" data-nb-words="53" data-nb-chars="273">There was a&nbsp;dead horse in&nbsp;the hollow by&nbsp;the path to&nbsp;my&nbsp;house, which compelled me&nbsp;sometimes to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;way, especially in&nbsp;the night when the air was heavy, but the assurance it&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;of&nbsp;the strong appetite and inviolable health of&nbsp;Nature was my&nbsp;compensation for this.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="230" id="idea230" data-nb-words="61" data-nb-chars="339">I&nbsp;love to&nbsp;see that Nature is&nbsp;so&nbsp;rife with life that myriads can be&nbsp;afforded to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sacrificed and suffered to&nbsp;prey on&nbsp;one another; that tender organizations can be&nbsp;so&nbsp;serenely squashed out of&nbsp;existence like pulp—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over in&nbsp;the road; and that sometimes it&nbsp;has rained flesh and blood!</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="241" id="idea241" data-nb-words="28" data-nb-chars="157">The sulphur-like pollen of&nbsp;the pitch pine soon covered the pond and the stones and rotten wood along the shore, so&nbsp;that you could have collected a&nbsp;barrelful.</span>
