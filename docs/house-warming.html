          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="24" id="idea24" data-nb-words="39" data-nb-chars="203">Each morning, when they were numbed with cold, I&nbsp;swept some of&nbsp;them out, but I&nbsp;did not trouble myself much to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;them; I&nbsp;even felt complimented by&nbsp;their regarding my&nbsp;house as&nbsp;a&nbsp;desirable shelter.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="25" id="idea25" data-nb-words="26" data-nb-chars="165">They never molested me&nbsp;seriously, though they bedded with me; and they gradually disappeared, into what crevices I&nbsp;do&nbsp;not know, avoiding winter and unspeakable cold.</span></p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="27" id="idea27" data-nb-words="18" data-nb-chars="100">I&nbsp;thus warmed myself by&nbsp;the still glowing embers which the summer, like a&nbsp;departed hunter, had left.</span></p>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="31" id="idea31" data-nb-words="27" data-nb-chars="145">Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age, and it&nbsp;would take many blows with a&nbsp;trowel to&nbsp;clean an&nbsp;old wiseacre of&nbsp;them.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="32" id="idea32" data-nb-words="33" data-nb-chars="185">Many of&nbsp;the villages of&nbsp;Mesopotamia are built of&nbsp;secondhand bricks of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good quality, obtained from the ruins of&nbsp;Babylon, and the cement on&nbsp;them is&nbsp;older and probably harder still.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="33" id="idea33" data-nb-words="24" data-nb-chars="129">However that may be, I&nbsp;was struck by&nbsp;the peculiar toughness of&nbsp;the steel which bore so&nbsp;many violent blows without being worn out.</span>
