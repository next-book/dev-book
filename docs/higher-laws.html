          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="3" id="idea3" data-nb-words="43" data-nb-chars="239">Once or&nbsp;twice, however, while I&nbsp;lived at&nbsp;the pond, I&nbsp;found myself ranging the woods, like a&nbsp;half-starved hound, with a&nbsp;strange abandonment, seeking some kind of&nbsp;venison which I&nbsp;might devour, and no&nbsp;morsel could have been too savage for me.</span>
          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="4" id="idea4" data-nb-words="7" data-nb-chars="53">The wildest scenes had become unaccountably familiar.</span>

          <span class="idea" data-nb-ref-number="28" id="idea28" data-nb-words="21" data-nb-chars="106">But I&nbsp;confess that I&nbsp;am&nbsp;now inclined to&nbsp;think that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;finer way of&nbsp;studying ornithology than this.</span>
